# AGENTS

## Project overview
- Minimal personal website built with Astro, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Working agreements
- Keep pages minimal and design-focused.
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS.
- Store shared UI in `src/components`.
- Document any new scripts or dependencies in `package.json`.

## Testing
- Run `npm run build` for production build checks when feasible.
